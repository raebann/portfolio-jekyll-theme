**INFO:**
In the world of Earnest, all your wishes, even the absurd ones, come true. The play asks us to picture an ideal life and, for a moment, imagine that it is real. In a story of ideals that places the trivial above the serious every time, it allows for one exception: love. In the world of Earnest, where escaping, reshaping, and rebuilding one’s self is as natural as breathing; where everything works out all right in the end; where the good end happily and the bad unhappily; love and joy are the all-powerful benefactors. A queer retelling of this classic play, featuring original music set to Oscar Wilde's sonnets as lyrics inside a fully inverting set, this fast-paced comedy is as raucous as it is tender. 

**PRESS:**
> “A clever set design, which changes three times during the show, helps to keep the stage interesting and the audience engaged. Overall, Bannerman makes good use of the stage, and characters are constantly moving, sitting, running, and taking up space, which is very entertaining.” - Hannah Lank, The Varsity 

> “As soon as the lights came up for the first act, the skill and expertise that went into designing and building the set were evident. Everything denoted late nineteenth century without seeming forced in the slightest; on the contrary, everything was quite unified...Kudos to the stage hands as well, dressed also in themed garb, for seamless turnarounds between scenes. And of course, many thanks to Rachel Bannerman for delivering such a fine show to the Bader stage. We are earnestly awaiting the next show.” - Aloysius Wong, The Strand 

> “So, how does the Victoria College Drama Society (VCDS) bring The Importance up to date? Judging by the first of three performances,...director Rachel Bannerman’s chosen strategy was to match impeccable production design with committed, deliberate performances...If nothing else, The Importance persists because we see that it belongs to us, in whichever sense of that relationship we choose. The artists of the VCDS understand this, and have amply communicated it to their audience. The production is also, it must be noted, screamingly funny, which is ultimately the truest sign of this play’s renewed success.” - Korto Zambeli-Tardif, The Mike 

> “The Victoria College Drama Society (VCDS) received resounding laughter and applause from pleased audiences with director Rachel Bannerman’s interpretation of The Importance of Being Earnest...Bannerman’s production understands that Earnest is ultimately a play of identity, where the central question is “Who am I?” It is a play that laughs at the absurdity of nothingness, of a purposeless existence, and fills that void with beauty and wit. In assembling a cast of mostly women and changing the character of Mr. Jack Worthing to a Ms. Jack Worthing, Bannerman brings the play into the twenty-first century in a manner that is quite fitting for the play’s central question of human identity.” - The Varsity
